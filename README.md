# node-stuff

I'll be publishing some node exercises I do on my free time to this repo starting from basics to more advanced features and frameworks. Feel free to explore the different apps as I go along.

``note-app:`` basic use of file system to create a note keeping app through the command line.

``weather-app:`` getting more into asynchronous operations. Use Google Maps API to geocode an address and grab the lat and long from that and use the Dark Sky API to get the current temperature. I explore nesting callbacks as well as chaining promises.

``node-web-server:`` Super basic web server using Express. Rendering pages with handlebars and using handlebar helpers

``node-tests:`` Exploring testing frameworks of node. I'm using Mocha, Expect, and Rewire in these. I explore asynchronous call testing and creating spies

``node-todo-api`` Basic API service for a todo list app. Uses mongoose, body-parser, lodash, and express. For tests, I am using mocha, expect, and supertest.



ES6 will try to be used where applicable.
